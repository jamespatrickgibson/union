# Text

## Basic usage

<Text>
  Legibility, in practice, amounts simply to what one is accustomed to. But this
  is not to say that because we have got used to something demonstrably less
  legible than something else would be if we could get used to it, we should
  make no effort to scrap the existing thing. This was done by the Florentines
  and Romans of the fifteenth century; it requires simply good sense in the
  originators good will in the rest of us.
