  ## Overview

  Union can be used in two ways: The CSS version is lightweight and can be
  used in any framework you choose. The Svelte version will be installable
  as an NPM package and ready to use in any Svelte project.

  #### Why Svelte

  Svelte is a new Javascript framework that is very lean, and incredibly
  designer friendly. It's single file components, and easy to learn syntax
  makes Svelte a great choice for designers to build with.

  The Svelte community is also just beginning to build good component
  libraries and UI frameworks, and could certainly use something like Union
  to jumpstart projects.

  #### Designing in the Open

  Since Union is such a new project, the design of the system will be continuously iterated in the open. For now, Union should be considered pre-release and unstable for any production use.

  #### Who?

  Union is currently designed and built by [@negativespace.io](https://twitter.com/negativespaceio)
