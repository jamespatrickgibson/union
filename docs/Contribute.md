# Contributing to the design system

This page explains the process (or processes) by which the design system gets updated

## People

Describe who’s involved in changes to the system. Describe who’s expected to do the work and who approves changes.

## Process

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

Describe specifically the process or processes by which the system gets updated. What happens when existing component need modified? What if an entire new component needs created? What happens if a component is deprecated? See Canonical’s fantastic decision tree for contributing changes to their design system.

Since a design system is made up of component code, guidelines, documentation, design tools, and resources, keep in mind you’ll likely need to define several processes to contribute each of these ingredients.
