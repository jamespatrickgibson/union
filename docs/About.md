# About

Union is a design system boilerplate and component library which is inspired by traditional graphic design theories and practices.

[View on Github](https://github.com/jamespatrickgibson/union)

## Overview

Union can be used in two ways: The CSS version is lightweight and can be
used in any framework you choose. The Svelte version will be installable
as an NPM package and ready to use in any Svelte project.

### Why Svelte

Svelte is a new Javascript framework that is very lean, and incredibly
designer friendly. It's single file components, and easy to learn syntax
makes Svelte a great choice for designers to build with.

The Svelte community is also just beginning to build good component
libraries and UI frameworks, and could certainly use something like Union
to jumpstart projects.

### Work in Progress

Since Union is such a new project, the design of the system will be
continuously iterated in the open. Many breaking changes are certain to occor
during the early phase of development.

**Union should be considered pre-release and currently unstable for production
use.**
