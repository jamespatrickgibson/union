# About

Union is a design system boilerplate and component library which is inspired by traditional graphic design theories and practices.

[View on Github](https://github.com/jamespatrickgibson/union)

## Usage

Union can be used in two ways: The CSS version is lightweight and can be used in any framework you choose. The React version will be installable as an NPM package and ready to use in any React project.

### Designing in the Open

Since Union is such a new project, the design of the system will be continuously iterated in the open. For now, Union should be considered pre-release and unstable for any production use.
