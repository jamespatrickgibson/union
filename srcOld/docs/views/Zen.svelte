  <Heading>Zen &amp; The Art of Design Systems</Heading>

  <Text size="1">
    Some call it &quot;seeing,&quot; some call it &quot;knowing,&quot; and some
    describe it in religious terms. Whatever the name, it is our reach for a new
    level of consciousness. Of the many forms this search has taken, perhaps the
    most intriguing is Zen. Growing out of the wisdom of China, India, and
    Japan, Zen became a powerful movement to explore the lesser-known reaches of
    the human mind. Today Zen has come westward, where we are rediscovering
    modern significance in its ancient insights. This book is an attempt to
    encounter Zen in its purest form, by returning to the greatest Zen masters.

  <Heading size="5">Zen teachings often appear deceptively simple.</Heading>
  <Text>
    This misconception is compounded by the Zen claim that explanations are
    meaningless. They are, of course, but merely because genuine Zen insights
    can arise only from individual experience. And although our experience can
    be described and even analyzed, it cannot be transmitted or shared. At most,
    the &quot;teachings&quot; of Zen can only clear the way to our deeper
    consciousness. The rest is up to us.

  <Heading size="6">
    Zen is based on the recognition of two incompatible types of thought:
    rational and intuitive.
  </Heading>
  <Text>
    Rationality employs language, logic, reason. Its precepts can be taught.
    Intuitive knowledge, however, is different. It lurks embedded in our
    consciousness, beyond words. Unlike rational thought, intuition cannot be
    &quot;taught&quot; or even turned on. In fact, it is impossible to find or
    manipulate this intuitive consciousness using our rational mind--any more
    than we can grasp our own hand or see our own eye.

    The Zen masters devised ways to reach this repressed area of human
    consciousness. Some of their techniques--like meditation--were borrowed from
    Indian Buddhism, and some--like their antirational paradoxes--may have been
    learned from Chinese Taoists. But other inventions, like their jarring
    shouts and blows, emerged from their own experience. Throughout it all,
    however, their words and actions were only a means, never an end.

  <Text>
    That end is an intuitive realization of a single great insight--that we and
    the world around are one, both part of a larger encompassing absolute. Our
    rational intellect merely obscures this truth, and consequently we must shut
    it off, if only for a moment. Rationality constrains our mind; intuition
    releases it.
  </Text>

  <Text>
    The irony is that the person glimpsing this moment of higher consciousness,
    this Oneness, encounters the ultimate realization that there is nothing to
    realize. The world is still there, unchanged. But the difference is that it
    is now an extension of our consciousness, seen directly and not
    analytically. And since it is redundant to be attached to something already
    a part of you, there is a sudden sense of freedom from our agonizing bondage
    to things.
  </Text>

  <Text>
    Along with this also comes release from the constraints of artificial
    values. Creating systems and categories is not unlike counting the colors of
    a rainbow--both merely detract from our experience of reality, while at the
    same time limiting our appreciation of the world's richness. And to declare
    something right or wrong is similarly nearsighted. As Alan Watts once
    observed, &quot;Zen unveils behind the urgent realm of good and evil a vast
    region of oneself about which there need be no guilt or recrimination, where
    at last the self is indistinguishable from God.&quot; And, we might add,
    where God is also one with our consciousness, our self. In Zen all dualities
    dissolve, absorbed in the larger reality that simply is.
  </Text>

  <Text>
    None of these things is taught explicitly in Zen. Instead they are
    discovered waiting in our consciousness after all else has been swept away.
    A scornful twelfth-century Chinese scholar summarized the Zen method as
    follows: &quot;Since the Zen masters never run the risk of explaining
    anything in plain language, their followers must do their own pondering and
    puzzling--from which a real threshing-out results.&quot; In these pages we
    will watch the threshing-out of Zen itself--as its masters unfold a new
    realm of consciousness, the Zen experience.
