      Some call it &quot;seeing,&quot; some call it &quot;knowing,&quot; and
      some describe it in religious terms. Whatever the name, it is our reach
      for a new level of consciousness. Of the many forms this search has taken,
      perhaps the most intriguing is Zen. Growing out of the wisdom of China,
      India, and Japan, Zen became a powerful movement to explore the
      lesser-known reaches of the human mind. Today Zen has come westward, where
      we are rediscovering modern significance in its ancient insights. This
      book is an attempt to encounter Zen in its purest form, by returning to
      the greatest Zen masters.

      Zen teachings often appear deceptively simple. This misconception is
      compounded by the Zen claim that explanations are meaningless. They are,
      of course, but merely because genuine Zen insights can arise only from
      individual experience. And although our experience can be described and
      even analyzed, it cannot be transmitted or shared. At most, the
      &quot;teachings&quot; of Zen can only clear the way to our deeper
      consciousness. The rest is up to us.
