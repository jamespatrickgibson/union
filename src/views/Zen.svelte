  <Heading>Zen &amp; The Art of Design Systems</Heading>

  <Text size="1">
    Some call it &quot;seeing,&quot; some call it &quot;knowing,&quot; and some
    describe it in religious terms. Whatever the name, it is our reach for a new
    level of consciousness. Of the many forms this search has taken, perhaps the
    most intriguing is Zen. Growing out of the wisdom of China, India, and
    Japan, Zen became a powerful movement to explore the lesser-known reaches of
    the human mind. Today Zen has come westward, where we are rediscovering
    modern significance in its ancient insights. This book is an attempt to
    encounter Zen in its purest form, by returning to the greatest Zen masters.

    Zen teachings often appear deceptively simple. This misconception is
    compounded by the Zen claim that explanations are meaningless. They are, of
    course, but merely because genuine Zen insights can arise only from
    individual experience. And although our experience can be described and even
    analyzed, it cannot be transmitted or shared. At most, the
    &quot;teachings&quot; of Zen can only clear the way to our deeper
    consciousness. The rest is up to us.

    Zen is based on the recognition of two incompatible types of thought:
    rational and intuitive. Rationality employs language, logic, reason. Its
    precepts can be taught. Intuitive knowledge, however, is different. It lurks
    embedded in our consciousness, beyond words. Unlike rational thought,
    intuition cannot be &quot;taught&quot; or even turned on. In fact, it is
    impossible to find or manipulate this intuitive consciousness using our
    rational mind--any more than we can grasp our own hand or see our own eye.
