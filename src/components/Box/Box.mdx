      Legibility, in practice, amounts simply to what one is accustomed to. But
      this is not to say that because we have got used to something demonstrably
      less legible than something else would be if we could get used to it, we
      should make no effort to scrap the existing thing. This was done by the
      Florentines and Romans of the fifteenth century; it requires simply good
      sense in the originators & good will in the rest of us.
