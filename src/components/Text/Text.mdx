# Text

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Text>
    Legibility, in practice, amounts simply to what one is accustomed to. But
    this is not to say that because we have got used to something demonstrably
    less legible than something else would be if we could get used to it, we
    should make no effort to scrap the existing thing. This was done by the
    Florentines and Romans of the fifteenth century; it requires simply good
    sense in the originators & good will in the rest of us.
